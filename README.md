# Car Advertisement Sentiment Analysis

## Project Goal/Motivation

This project aims to fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment analysis on car advertisements. Project Goal and Motivation
Problem Statement
The used car market is a dynamic area, changing rapidly and buyers find themselves — many times — lost in making decisions due to a huge number of options plus the varying prices available. The primary issue this initiative seeks to address is placing used car prices into correct categories such as low-cost and mid-range among others. This classification can enable prospective buyers to easily determine the price bracket of a vehicle, thus rationalizing their choice.

Motivation
This initiative was born out of the aspiration to make it easier for buyers of pre-owned vehicles to decide. The used car industry is huge and varied; prices are determined by many factors including brand, model, year of production, mileage, fuel type and others. We plan on creating a model that can effectively determine the classification of car prices— this tool is designed for those who take interest in such markets which are difficult to navigate without assistance.

Relevance
There are a few reasons why this project is important:

Consumer aid: When we categorize car prices, we're actually offering consumers a straightforward metric that allows them to easily compare cars. This might save time for people looking to buy a car and reduce the complexity of the decision.

Market research: If you're a car dealer or work in market analysis, being able to group cars into different price categories can help understand what customers are looking for and set competitive prices.

The project illustrates the use of data science and machine learning in practical applications, emphasizing how important it is to make decisions based on data in everyday life.

Moreover, the project demonstrates the use of cutting-edge machine learning models like BERT — an indication that contemporary AI techniques can effectively deal with dynamic and heterogeneous datasets.

Expected Impact
After successfully implementing and optimizing our model, we hope to see these effects take place:

Enhanced buyer experience: The changes result in an increased number of buyers that can make quick and well-informed decisions, which leads to greater satisfaction.
Enhanced market transparency: Through a clear classification of the car prices, we may be able to establish a more transparent market with its pricing strategies being better understood.
Educational interest: This work presents an opportunity for individuals involved in the academic field or those seeking practical case studies.
In general, this project is designed to close the distance between convoluted data and actual decision-making in order that it might be more simple for customers to steer through the used car market and the stakeholders to make sense of market dynamics.
